# U.S Population and Access to Health Care.

Capstone project for Part time Data Analytics Cohort #4 program at Nashville Software School

Executive Summary

Our country’s health system has experienced several changes over the last few years. This project’s goal is to assess different aspects of how insurance coverage, population demographics interacted with this change over time relative to the care our citizens receive. While healthcare is a broad subject, I will delve into how the US population interacted with the implementation of Affordable Care Act (ACA).

The Health care reform law enacted in March 2010 (sometimes known as ACA, PPACA, or “Obamacare”) with
 3 Primary Goals:

 1.  Make affordable health insurance available to more people.
 2. Expand the Medicaid program to cover all adults with income below 138% of the federal poverty level
 3. Support innovative medical care delivery methods designed to lower the costs of health care generally.


 Motivation

 I ask myself every day, are insurance companies fair to individuals when we pay one of the highest premiums in the world to manage our health risk as we age. Did our Law makers of our country place our population in the right direction? A key measure of success is whether the number of uninsured Americans drop. If that is the case, what segments of the population require more attention?

 Data Questions

 1. How has the US population grown over two decades?
 2. Which States have gained the highest momentum of settlement?
 3. What percent of the population had insurance coverage prior to ACA act and after ACA act? Which States achieved better vs worst results?
